"""Recursive benchmark-driven task decomposition (vector).

The user's core finding, measured instead of assumed: the same models that
pass a tightly-specified task routinely fall over when the same work is
described in broad terms. VECTOR turns that into a lever the swarm can pull:

  - It re-benchmarks every task three ways (BROAD / DEFAULT / FOCUSED) through
    the exact flint harness bench_swarm uses, so accuracy / quickness / spend
    become functions of SPECIFICATION INTENSITY, not just of the model.
  - The resulting focus_gain (accuracy delta from BROAD to FOCUSED, plus
    quickness/spend deltas) is the measurable "how much does this task need a
    sharper contract" number.
  - Failed tasks are split by a DECOMPOSER that must return SMALLER, MORE
    FOCUSED subtask contracts, and the recursion re-measures each child until
    gains saturate (stop rule) or the depth cap is reached. The result is a
    decomposition tree whose every node carries its own measured focus_gain.
  - Every experiment's measured outcome rewards the `decomposer` bandit arm in
    learn.py (Learner) and feeds the playbook as lessons (focus helped) and
    pitfalls (focus did not help) — so the deployment-side splitter and
    planner inherit the same reinforcement as the bench.
  - --apply <slug> renders the learned focus preamble into the live swarmd
    PLANNER / DECOMPOSER prompts via the same append_json_block seam the
    benchmark uses, so a lesson proven here reaches the real swarm.

Trigger:  .venv/bin/python swarm/vector.py run --task 2 --model <m>
Self-loop: the same command with --loop re-runs the battery forever, writing
plan / journal / trend evidence under swarm/vector_state/, ready for a
scheduler or launcher (start-vector-loop.command) to keep it alive.
